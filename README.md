# Magedbm - Magento Database Backup Manager

Provides a simpler way for developers to retrieve sanitised Magento database backups without requiring server access.

## About

Working on Magento client sites typically requires a fresh copy of the production database in order to minimise differences
within local environment.  This is a pain for numerous reason:

- Requires developer to have access to SSH

- Staging is regularly out of date as well 


## Installation



## Usage


`bin/magedbm configure`




`bin/magedbm put project-name`
